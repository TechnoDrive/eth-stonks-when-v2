# eth-stonks-when

## What is **EthStonksWhen**?
EthStonksWhen is a command line application designed to alert the user (via a native Windows notification) when ETH (a cryptocurrency) reaches a certain value.

## How do I use EthStonksWhen?
After installing Node.js, and unzipping the file, run the following command in a windows cmd prompt (`WIN + S + "CMD" + ENTER`):
`launch`
This will install the needed modules, and run the app.

## How do I install `Node.js`?
1. Go to the [Node.js Website](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Click the **"14.12.0"** download button.
3. Run the installer. 

**NOTE:** Make sure to click "Add to PATH" during the installation, so that you can use the command globally.

## Why not just make an executable?
Some files in the module I'm using to send a notification cannot be packaged.

## Supported Operating Systems?
Should work on Windows, might work on Linux.
Cross-platform **will** be added on v3 (as of right now it's v2).

## Known Bugs
At the moment, none.
